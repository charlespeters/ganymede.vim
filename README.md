Ganymede is a color scheme inspired by the icy coldness of the moons of Jupiter contrasted against all the bright vibrant colors that my personality comprises.

This was designed using Neovim and will work in both terminal Vim and Neovim.


## Installation

Add `charlespeters/vim-ganymede` to whatever plugin system you're using (Pathogen, Vundle, etc). In your `.vimrc` add:

```vim
set t_Co=256
colorscheme ganymede

let g:airline_theme='ganymede'
```
